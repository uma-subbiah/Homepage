- I enjoy poetry writing and maintain a blog of my poems at [https://thegoldenaurora.wordpress.com](https://thegoldenaurora.wordpress.com).

<!-- I'm also passionate about spreading technology in the community and write technical articles, how-to's and interesting advances at [https://thegoldencode.wordpress.com](https://thegoldencode.wordpress.com). -->

- I believe in giving back to the society, and have participated in multiple marathons and fundraisers for the Coimbatore Cancer Foundation.

- I am an avid traveller and enjoy painting and cooking.

- I am always excited to take up responsibility to organise technical events. During my undergrad, I served as the Event Manager for ML Marksman at the techfest Anokha (Feb ‘19), organised and lead 'Abraca~data' – a deep learning workshop (Dec '18). I was also the evaluator & volunteer for ML Marksman - a competition, at Anokha (Feb '18)

- In school, I was the Student Editor of the Editorial Board (2013-14), the Head Girl (2012-13), the Vice Captain of one of the school houses (2011-12) and Project Coordinator (2012)
