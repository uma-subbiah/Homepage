Hi!

I'm Uma Subbiah and I'm currently pursuing a ____ at the ____, ____.
Before joining here, I completed my undergrad degree in India - a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. I graduated in 2020 (yes, the batch of 2020!) with a GPA of 9.91 / 10 , ranking first among 380 students in the department. I graduated with a first class degree and was awarded distinction for my research contributions.

I'm enthusiastic about Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. When I'm not working on research projects or dreaming about AI for the future, you'll find me writing poems, organising events for technical communities on campus, reading a good novel or predicting the end to a crime mystery series!
