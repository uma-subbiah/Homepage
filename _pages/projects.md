##
_September '20_
<br>

In July 2020, I passed the Tensorflow Developer Certificate program. This exciting exam (and the preparatory course) left me hungry for more. I've been curious about the use of Tensorflow for different platforms, and on the journey to satisfy this curiousity, I've been exploring Tensorflow.js.

## Hospital Location Predictor in London
_August '19_
<br>
I used the skills I gained from IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate program to design a system that predicts the ideal location of constructing a new hospital in London using data science techniques. This project employs data collection (web scraping), data cleaning, data visualisation and K-NN prediction techniques. I've written a post on this, which can be found here:

## Fuzzy Logic based Heart Condition Predictor
_May '19_
<br>
Inspired by the scope of fuzzy logic and its ability to predict the outcome of vague, uncertain scenarios, I worked on the use of fuzzy logic to predict heart disease. I used three variables - age, blood pressure and cholestrol levels. These variables were obtained from a literature review of medical articles, but can easily be modified/augmented, depending on the requirements of the medial professional using the system. The output is the level of risk of suffering a heart attack.

## Simple Neural Network Algorithm Implementation
_April '19_
<br>
This month I've been working on the implementation of neural network algorithms, either from their original papers or from simplified articles. In this endeavour, I've implemented activation functions, the perceptron learning algorithm and boolean gates using single / mulit- layer neural network structures.

## IDC Cancer Prediction
_Feb ’19_
<br>
Worked in a team of 2 members to refine and outperform the existing neural networks for predicting the presence or absence of breast cancer (IDC) in histology images. Achieved an accuracy of 94% using a combination of convolutional layers obtained by trial and error.

## Tamil Character Recognition System
_Jan '19_
<br>
Tamil is one of the oldest languages in the world. I built an extendable prototype neural network that was able to classify 5 characters in Tamil. Achieved an accuracy of > 98%. I used a Tamil character dataset that has been generously open-sourced for the development of technology in Tamil by the University of Jaffna.
