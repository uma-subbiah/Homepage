## B.Tech Final Project
_June ’19 – Jun '20_
<br>
Worked in a team of 4 members on the analysis and enhancement of deep learning architecture to enhance non-uniformly illuminated images. Realising the potential scope of this in the medical domain, we expanded our work in this direction, resulting in 2 publications - please see the 1st and 2nd entries under Publications -> Conference Proceedings
